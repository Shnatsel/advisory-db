  "details": "Affected versions of this crate is not panic safe within callback functions `stream_callback` and `stream_finished_callback`.\n\nThe call to user-provided closure might panic before a `mem::forget` call, which then causes a use after free that grants attacker to control the callback function pointer.\n\nThis allows an attacker to construct an arbitrary code execution .\n \nThe flaw was reported by Phosphorus15.",
