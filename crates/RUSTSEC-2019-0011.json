  "summary": "Flaw in offset_of and span_of causes SIGILL, drops uninitialized memory of arbitrary type on panic in client code",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate caused traps and/or memory unsafety by zero-initializing references.\nThey also could lead to uninitialized memory being dropped if the field for which the offset is requested was behind a deref coercion, and that deref coercion caused a panic.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by using `MaybeUninit`.",
