  "summary": "Improper uniqueness verification of signature threshold",
  "details": "The tough library, prior to 0.7.1, does not properly verify the uniqueness of\nkeys in the signatures provided to meet the threshold of cryptographic\nsignatures. It allows someone with access to a valid signing key to create\nmultiple valid signatures in order to circumvent TUF requiring a minimum\nthreshold of unique keys before the metadata is considered valid.\n\nAWS would like to thank Erick Tryzelaar of the Google Fuchsia Team for\nreporting this issue.\n\nA fix is available in version 0.7.1.\n\nCVE-2020-6174 is assigned to the same issue in the TUF reference\nimplementation.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, contact AWS Security\nat aws-security@amazon.com.",
