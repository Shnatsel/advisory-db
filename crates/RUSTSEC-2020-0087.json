  "summary": "TryMutex<T> allows sending non-Send type across threads",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for `TryMutex<T>` type.\n\nThis allows users to put non-Send `T` type in `TryMutex` and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding `T: Send` bound for the Sync trait implementation.",
