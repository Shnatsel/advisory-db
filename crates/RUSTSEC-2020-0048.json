  "summary": "Use-after-free in BodyStream due to lack of pinning",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in `BodyStream` to be pinned,\nbut treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by making the trait `MessageBody` require `Unpin`\nand making `poll_next()` function accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`.",
