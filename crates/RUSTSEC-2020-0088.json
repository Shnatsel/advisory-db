  "summary": "MPMCConsumer/Producer allows sending non-Send type across threads",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Sync` and `Send` traits for `MPMCConsumer` and `MPMCProducer` types.\n\nThis allows users to send types that do not implement `Send` trait across thread boundaries, which can cause a data race.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in the 2.0.1 release by adding `T: Send` bound to affected Sync/Send trait implementations.",
