  "summary": "Allows viewing and modifying arbitrary structs as bytes",
  "details": "Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any type `T` wrapped in `RGB<T>` as bytes,\nand do not correctly constrain `RGB<T>` and other wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.\n\nSafety violation possible for a type wrapped in `RGB<T>` and similar wrapper structures:\n\n * If `T` contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized memory.\n * If `T` contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing of arbitrary pointers.\n * Any safety and/or validity invariants for `T` may be violated.\n \nThe issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB crate to implement an unsafe marker trait.",
