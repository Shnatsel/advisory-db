  "details": "`through` and `through_and` take a mutable reference as well as a mapping\nfunction to change the provided reference. They do this by calling `ptr::read`\non the reference which duplicates ownership and then calling the mapping\nfunction.\n\nIf the mapping function panics, both the original object and the one\nduplicated by `ptr::read` get dropped, causing a double free.",
