  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in `Framed` to be pinned,\nbut treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by making the affected functions accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`.",
