  "details": "Upon panic in a user-provided function `f`, `fn mutate()` & `fn mutate2` drops twice a same object.\n\nAffected versions of this crate did not guard against double drop while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership with `ptr::read()`.\n\nDropping a same object can result in memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version \"0.9.11\" by fixing the code to abort upon panic.",
