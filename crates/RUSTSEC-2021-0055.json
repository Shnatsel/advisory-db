  "details": "An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation\nClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits\nthe signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial\nClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL\npointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service\nattack.\n\nA server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which\nis the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this\nissue.",
