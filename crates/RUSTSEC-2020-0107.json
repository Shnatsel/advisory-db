  "summary": "hashconsing's HConsed lacks Send/Sync bound for its Send/Sync trait.",
  "details": "Affected versions of `hashconsing` implements `Send`/`Sync` for its `HConsed` type without restricting it to `Send`able types and `Sync`able types.\n\nThis allows non-`Sync` types such as `Cell` to be shared across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.",
