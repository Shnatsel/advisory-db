  "summary": "VecCopy allows misaligned access to elements",
  "details": "`VecCopy::data` is created as a Vec of u8 but can be used to store and retrieve\nelements of different types leading to misaligned access.\n\nThe issue was resolved in v0.5.0 by replacing data being stored by `Vec<u8>` with a custom managed\npointer.  Elements are now stored and retrieved using types with proper alignment corresponding to\noriginal types.",
