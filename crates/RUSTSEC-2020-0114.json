  "summary": "`Demuxer` can carry non-Send types across thread boundaries",
  "details": "In the affected versions of this crate, `Demuxer<T>` unconditionally implemented `Send` with no trait bounds on `T`.\n\nThis allows sending a non-Send type `T` across thread boundaries, which can cause undefined behavior like unlocking a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex, or memory corruption from data race.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 0562cbf by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl for `Demuxer<T>`.",
