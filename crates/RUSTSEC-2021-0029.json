  "details": "Affected versions of this crate passed an unininitialized buffer to a\nuser-provided `Read` instance in `Tape::take_bytes`.\n\nThis can result in safe `Read` implementations reading from the uninitialized\nbuffer leading to undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `1f2dc7f37dd` by removing the unsafe block\nand zero-initializing the buffer.",
